SighhShare is a modern, privacy-focused web application that facilitates temporary file sharing. Users can upload files, receive a unique shareable code, and define an expiration period for the content. It's built with a fully serverless architecture, ensuring scalability, cost-efficiency, and ease of deployment.

## âœ¨ Features

* **Temporary File Sharing:** Upload files and set automatic expiration times (1 hour, 5 hours, 1 day).
* **Unique Shareable Codes:** Each uploaded file generates a unique 5-character code for easy retrieval.
* **Persistent Storage:** File metadata (filename, URL, expiration) is securely stored using Firebase Firestore.
* **Cloud-Based File Storage:** Actual file content is hosted on Cloudinary, providing reliable and scalable storage.
* **Secure Uploads:** Files are uploaded directly from the client to Cloudinary using securely generated signatures, minimizing serverless function overhead and enhancing security.
* **Intuitive UI:** Clean and responsive user interface for a smooth sharing experience.
* **Theme Toggling:** Switch between dark and light modes for personalized viewing.
* **Retrieve by Code:** Easily access shared files using their unique code.
